    <h1 id="main">A Brief Explanation of Physics Engines</h1>
    
<div id="paragraph">Physics Engines are the cornerstone of both 2d and 3d games which involve forces and 
movements. While in many games they can be very complex to take into account many different 
factors (wind, gravity, gliding etc). Letâ€™s look at creating a simple Physics Engine and 
some of the simple math that can have a powerful effect in a game and make it engaging and realistic.

<div id="paragraph">The first step is to outline what it is we want to accomplish. To keep it simple, lets
    make a simple bouncing ball. I have made a simple sketch in p5js for us to experiment with. We'll first draw our ball and the ground:
</div>
    <div id="space"></div> 
    <div id="p5Container">
        <script id="p5js" src="sketches\Phys_Engine\ball1.js"></script>
    </div>
    <div id="space"></div> 
<div id="paragraph"> 
    Now we have our ball and our ground we have to look at what we want to accomplish. Since we want the ball to bounce we have two things to consider: Gravity and Collision. We need
    Gravity to allow our ball fall towards the ground and we need collisions to make sure the ball bounces off the ground and doesn't fall offscreen.
